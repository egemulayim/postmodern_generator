"""
A module for generating coherent paragraphs in generated essays.
This module provides functions to create paragraphs with a focus on
thematic coherence, using a variety of transitional expressions and rhetorical devices.
It includes functions to generate paragraphs for different sections of an essay,
such as introductions, general discussions, and conclusions.
The paragraphs are designed to be thematically consistent, incorporating
philosophical concepts, terms, and references to philosophers.
The module also includes a function to ensure proper capitalization
of sentences and proper nouns, as well as a function to generate
metafictional elements for self-referential commentary.
The generated paragraphs are intended to reflect the complexity and depth
of postmodern academic writing, while also adhering to conventional
academic standards and MLA 9 citation formatting.
