    "In attempting to conclude this essay, we find ourselves caught in the very {concept} we sought to analyze, a testament to its pervasive influence.",
    "This essay, in its attempt to map {concept}, has perhaps only succeeded in demonstrating the complexity and elusiveness of {term}.",
    "The intertextuality of this analysis reflects the inherent complexity of the relationship between {concept} and {term}.",
    "If there is a conclusion to be drawn from our examination of {term}, it is perhaps that {concept} continues to resist theoretical closure.",
    "As this paper draws to a close—a closure that is always provisional—we are left not with answers about {concept} and {term}, but with more refined questions.",
    "The paradox, of course, is that in critiquing {concept}, this essay has enacted the very {term} it has sought to problematize.",
    "To conclude, if such a gesture is possible, is to acknowledge that any engagement with {concept} necessarily participates in the very {term} it seeks to elucidate.",
    "What emerges from this investigation is not a definitive account of {concept}, but a recognition of its irreducible entanglement with {term}.",
    "The reflexivity required to analyze {concept} inevitably implicates this text in the economy of {term} it has attempted to critique.",
    "Perhaps the most significant insight to emerge from this analysis is the recognition that {concept} and {term} remain sites of productive undecidability."
