## Development Notes

**Version 0.1.0** marks the transition from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready academic text generator. The architectural changes lay the foundation for future enhancements while significantly improving the quality and consistency of generated content.

**Breaking Changes**: This version requires Python 3.8+ and introduces a new command-line interface. Previous direct function calls may need updating to work with the new architecture.

**Migration Guide**: Users upgrading from pre-1.0 versions should note the new CLI interface and thematic clustering system. All previous functionality is preserved but accessed through the new interface.

**Contributor Notes**: The JSON-based data architecture makes it easier to contribute new content. See the contributing guidelines in README.md for details on extending the knowledge base.
