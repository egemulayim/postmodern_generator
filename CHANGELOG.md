## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to accurately reflect command-line argument behavior:
    - If only `--theme` is provided, a random seed is used, and the user is not prompted for a seed.
- Enhanced `README.md` description of the Markdown export feature:
    - Clarified that the exported metadata includes the generation timestamp.
    - Clarified that the actual seed value (whether user-specified or randomly generated) is recorded in the metadata.
