"""
A module for generating sentence data for a postmodern essay generator.
It contains advanced templates for sentence generation
in generated essays.
This module includes templates for introductions, conclusions,
general statements, and rhetorical questions.
It also includes metafictional elements that reflect on the writing process itself.
The templates are designed to be flexible and can be filled with various
concepts, terms, and philosophers.
The templates are categorized into different sections for easy access.
